          <h2>Volunteer with FWCAT</h2>
          <p>Each year FWCAT hosts our Break the Chains 5K race/walk fundraiser in May. It is the largest anti-human trafficking event in Washington State and we need volunteers like you to make it happen! We also have an awareness/education kiosk stationed year-round at the Federal Way Commons Mall and need volunteers to staff it. If you are interested in these or other volunteer opportunities, let us know! Weâ€™d love to have you join our team!</p>

          <p>Fill out our <a href="/fwcat-volunteer-interest-form/">volunteer interest form</a> to get started.</p>
